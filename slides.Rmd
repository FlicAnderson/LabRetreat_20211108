Bio: 

Flic Anderson is a Research Assistant in Bioinformatics in the Wallace Lab (within the Institute for Cell Biology) at the University of Edinburgh. The Wallace Lab works to understand how translation works within cells (particularly of fungi) and what factors control and regulate protein synthesis. 

Flic is part of the development team for the 'riboviz' open source software package for processing and analysis of ribosome profiling data, working with colleagues from EPCC (University of Edinburgh) to make the codebase more robust & sustainable.   

With a background in Ecology and Botany (previously a Research Assistant at the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh), Flic has worked with a wide range of types of biological data using different software tools and programming languages (particularly R) for the last 8 years, and found herself drawn towards bioinformatics and research software engineering. 

Flic is a member of the Edinburgh Carpentries and a certified Carpentries instructor in foundational coding and data science skills for researchers. 


Title: 
#########


Abstract:  

'riboviz' is an open source software package for processing and analysing ribosome profiling (RNA sequence) data.

Including a short primer on what Workflow Management Systems such as Nextflow 'do' and why they're useful for complex data pipelines, and details on how to get Rmarkdown HTML reports to play nicely as part of a Nextflow workflow.

## HOW TO (RE-)USE THIS MATERIAL

This is a `.html` presentation created in `R Markdown` with `ioslides`. 

(It's been written in a [.Rmd](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) file, and I generated .html slides by 'knitting' it in Rstudio.)

You can check out the code used to make these slides at the [Talk repo](https://github.com/FlicAnderson/LabTalk-riboviz-20210510) on Github, and adapt it for your own presentations if you like - there's a MIT Licence on the repo, which means: 

*"Basically, you can do whatever you want as long as you include the original copyright and license notice in any copy of the software/source."*
